#You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

# 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
# 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
# 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# Load activity labels + features
